## What should I do if I miss a workshop?

Don't panic! We're all busy. If you miss a regularly scheduled workshop, consider going to the makeup workshop that week. If that doesn't fit your schedule either, all the materials used in the workshops (Including the starting and ending state of whatever we worked on) are neatly organized in this repo. The READMEs in each folder will briefly describe what we did during the workshop so you can get a grasp of what we covered.
